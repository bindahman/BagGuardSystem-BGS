# BagGuard System (BGS)
**Final Year Project – Computer Science**

## 📌 Project Overview
The BagGuard System (BGS) is an AI-based computer vision system designed to detect and monitor unattended baggage in public spaces such as airports. The system aims to improve public safety by identifying luggage items, associating them with nearby individuals, and triggering alerts when bags are left unattended for a defined period.

This project is developed as part of a Final Year Project (FYP) and focuses on real-time detection, tracking, and risk assessment using deep learning techniques.
