# Smart-Baggage-Release-System-SBRS-
### **“Clear the gate, skip the wait.”**

A simulated airport automation system that synchronises **immigration clearance** with **baggage release**, ensuring safer, faster, and more controlled baggage collection for passengers.

---

##  Project Overview
The *Smart Baggage Release System (SBRS)* is designed to modernise airport baggage handling by introducing intelligent automation.  
The system ensures that luggage is released **only when passengers have cleared immigration**, reducing the risk of:

- Theft  
- Early collection  
- Long waiting times  
- Lost or mixed-up luggage  

The project is fully simulated using Python and synthetic (GDPR-safe) data.

##  Key Features
- **AI Priority Engine:** Decides release order based on immigration clearance and scan time.  
- **IoT-style Scanning Simulation:** Mimics smart gates using QR/RFID-style logic.  
- **Automated Release Logic:** Ensures bags are only released under the correct conditions.  
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of logic for easy testing and development.  
- **GDPR-Compliant:** Uses only synthetic, anonymised data.  
- **Simulation Notebook:** Demonstrates the full workflow step-by-step.
